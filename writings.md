## Dronea2: Control of Drones and Cybersecurity
`Dronea2` is a specialized software aimed at providing more secure and versatile drone control, particularly targeting DJI Tello drones. The project integrates functionalities for drone piloting, real-time facial detection through OpenCV, and a comprehensive set of cybersecurity tools to detect and mitigate drone-specific attacks.

## Benefits, Abuses, and the Rise of Decentralized Threats
Drones have brought about incredible benefits in various industries such as agriculture, mapping, and delivery services. However, their decentralized nature also makes them a target for malicious uses like unauthorized surveillance and payload delivery. This project aims to address these threats and provide mitigation strategies.

## Natural Language Processing with News and Elasticsearch
The project incorporates a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine powered by Elasticsearch. It collects news articles related to drone threats and cybersecurity, processes them, and provides insightful analytics. This can be instrumental for organizations looking to understand the evolving threat landscape.

## Email Notification for Gophish
Gophish notifications have been integrated into the system. Upon the detection of any unauthorized activities, an automated email alert is sent to the administrators, thereby facilitating rapid response to potential threats.

## Python RAT for Windows
A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) written in Python for Windows is also part of this suite. While primarily aimed for educational and research purposes, it highlights the vulnerabilities that can be exploited in drone control systems running on Windows platforms.
