## Abstract

Decentralized systems, such as distributed ledgers and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), aim to offer more open and robust services. Though designed to democratize information access and resist censorship, these technologies have also been embraced by cybercriminals, paving the way for illicit activities like ransomware. This evolving form of malicious software locks users out of their data and demands a ransom for its release, a growing concern primarily affecting businesses. 

## Introduction

Ransomware developers have quickly adopted blockchain technologies, using them not only for the anonymous collection of ransoms in cryptocurrencies but also as a means of storage and communication. While the blockchain is not ideal for storing large amounts of data, IPFS emerges as an attractive, decentralized alternative. It's robust, anonymous, and has been used by malware to conceal communications, creating a security problem that's difficult to tackle.

## How Attackers Utilize IPFS and Blockchain

In today's attack landscape, attackers install an IPFS client on a system under their control—be it their computer, a compromised machine, or an anonymous VPS. Once they upload a harmful file to the IPFS network, the file remains available and is automatically redistributed across various IPFS network nodes, even if the original computer is shut down. This process not only eliminates a single point of failure but also makes IPFS servers challenging to take down, unlike traditional malware servers.

## The Changing Landscape of Cybercrime

Cybercrime has evolved into a global underground economy, now estimated to be worth a trillion dollars—approximately 1.5% of the global GDP. Criminals no longer operate merely as individuals but are organized into services like "Ransomware as a Service" (RaaS). This system leverages Ethereum blockchain technology and IPFS to maximize privacy and automate payments.

## The Human Element

Affected users are often redirected to malicious IPFS files, commonly through fraudulent links. Attackers capitalize on the human tendency not to verify links before clicking on them and employ social engineering tactics to manipulate and deceive victims.

## Short-term and Long-term Solutions

For short-term solutions, some cybersecurity experts recommend blocking access to all IPFS gateways, especially for organizations not associated with Web3 or NFT technologies. However, this is not a long-term solution. As Web3 evolves and NFT/blockchain applications become more mainstream on IPFS, disconnecting from this network will be increasingly unlikely for many users.

Blocking IPFS gateways in malicious files will continue to be difficult due to IPFS's decentralized and resilient nature. Attackers only need to change a few characters in the file to create a new hash signature and a new IPFS file, redistributed across different nodes.

## Conclusion

The primary aim of this study is to raise awareness and prepare the research and security communities for new threats arising from blockchain and IPFS technologies. It underscores the need to develop effective strategies to combat these new forms of cybercrime.
