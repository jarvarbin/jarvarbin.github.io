Before becoming a pentester in a red team, I worked in various capacities where I blended my technical skills in software and cybersecurity with my ability to serve as an interlocutor and mediator between technical and managerial profiles. Eager to lead, create, and consistently develop new ideas or projects, I bring a unique combination of capability, energy, and persistence to my role. For the last two years, I have been exclusively focused on the technical aspects of penetration testing, further honing my expertise in cybersecurity. My experience also extends to acting as a vital communication link in multi-disciplinary projects, allowing for seamless project execution.

Just like my earlier experiences where I was involved in various research and development roles, my current focus is on proactively identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing system security. Outside of work, I am an enthusiastic individual who enjoys drones, technology, and electronics.
